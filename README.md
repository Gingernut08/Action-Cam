This project is a compact, DIY camera system built using an ESP32-CAM, designed specifically for use while kayaking. It captures photos or short video clips and stores them locally on a microSD card, keeping the setup simple and self-contained. The focus is on low power use, minimal size, and reliability in a splash-prone environment rather than high-end video quality. Housed in a sealed enclosure and powered by a battery, it’s meant to be mounted on a kayak to document trips, conditions, and moments on the water in a lightweight way.
